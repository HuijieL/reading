# The Context
Anyone who wishes to master an activity must first understand its tools and rules. This is as true of critical thinking as it is of golf,
carpentry, flying a plane, or brain surgery. In critical thinking, however, the tools are not material objects but concepts, and the rules govern mental rather than physical performance.

This first section explores seven important concepts *individuality, critical thinking , truth, knowledge, opinion, evidence, and argument*-- with a chapter devoted to each. Most of these
concepts are so familiar that you may be inclined to wonder whether there is any point to examining them. The answer is yes, for three reasons. First , much of what  is commonly believed  about these concepts
is mistaken. Second, who ever examines them carefully is always rewarded with fresh insights. Third, the more thorough your knowledge of these concepts, the more proficient you will be in your thinking.


# Who are you ?
Suppose someone asked you”Who are you?” It would be simple enough to respond with your name. But if the person wanted to know the entire story about who you are, the question would be more difficult to answer. You’d obviously have to include all your sentiments ad preferences, even the secret ones you’ve never shared with anyone—your affection with; your dislike of your older sister’s  husband; your allegiance  to your favorite  beverage , brand of clothing , and music.

Your attitudes couldn’t be overlooked  wither— your impatience when an issue gets complex, your aversion to certain courses, your fear of high places and dogs and speaking in public. The list would  go on. To be complete, it would have to include all your characteristics — not only the physical but also the emotional and intellectual.
To provide all the that information would be quite a chore. But suppose the questioner was still curious and asked, “How did you get the way you are ?” If your patience were not yet exhausted, chances are you would like to answer something like this:”I’m this way because I choose to be, because I considered other sentiments and preferences and attitudes and have made my selections. The ones I have chosen fit my style and personality best” . That answer is natural enough , and in part it’s true. But in a larger sense, it’s not true. The impact of the world on all of us is much greater than most of us realize.

## The Influence of Time and Place
Not only you are a member of a particular species. *Homo sapiens*,but you also exist at a particular time in the history of that species and in a particular place on the planet. That time and place are defined by specific circumstances, understandings, beliefs, and customs, all of which limit your experience and influence your thought patterns. If you had lived in America in colonial times, you likely would have had no objection to the practice of barring women  from serving on a jury, entering into a legal contract, owing property, or voting. If you have lived in nineteenth century, you would have had no objection to young children being denied an education and being hired out by their parents to work sixteen  hours a day, nor would you have given any thought to the special needs of adolescence. (The concert of adolescence was not invented until 1904.)

If you have been raised in the Middle East , you would stand much closer to people you converse with than you do in America. If you have raised in India, you might be perfectly comfortable having your parents choose your spouse for you. If your native  language were Spanish and your knowledge of English modest, you probably would be confused by some English colloquialisms. James Henslin  offers two amusing examples: Chevrolet novas initially sold very poorly in Mexico because *no va*in Spanish means “it doesn’t work”; and Perdue chickens were regarded with a certain suspicion(or worse)because the company’s slogan— “It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken”— became in Spanish “It takes an aroused man to make a chicken affectionate”.
 People who grow up in Europe , Asia , or South America have very different ideas of punctuality. As Daniel Goleman explain, ”Five minutes is late but permissible for a business appointment in the U.S.”, but thirty minutes is normal in Arab countries. In England five to fifteen minutes is the “correct” lateness for one invited to dinner; an Italian might two hours late, an Ethiopian still later, a Javanese not at all, having accepted only to prevent his host’s losing face. A different ethnic origin would also mean different tastes in food. Instead of craving a New York Strip steak and French fries, you might crave “raw monkey brains” or “camel’s milk cheese patties cured in dry camel’s dung” and washed down with “warm camel’s blood.” Sociologist Ian Robertson summed up the range of global dietary differences  succinctly: “Americans eat oysters but not snails. The French eat snails but no locusts. The Zulus eat locusts but not fish. The Jews eat fish but not pork. The Hindus eat pork but not beef. The Russians eat beef but not snakes. The Chinese eat snakes but not people. The Jare of New Guinea find people delicious.”

To sum up, living in a different age of or culture would make you a different person. Even if you rebelled against the values of your time and place, they still would represented the context of your life— in other words, they still would influence your responses.
